            LOTTE Wellfood Co. Ltd., Korea, the parent company of Lotte Group,
            opened its doors in 1967 and swiftly solidified its reputation as a
            leader of Korea’s food industry. LOTTE Wellfood Co. Ltd. enjoys
            leadership status in gums, candies, biscuits, chocolates and ice
            cream in Korea. Juicy Fresh, Spearmint, Freshmint chewing gums and
            Ghana Chocolates have served as long-time favorites for over four
            decades. Xylitol chewing gum continues to grow strong since its
            launch - thanks to its ability to reduce risk of tooth decay. To
            this end, it has been adding new business lines in the domestic
            market, growing existing business while actively participating in
            the overseas markets.
